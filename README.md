# Blog
Hello, this repository contains my personal blog. I've decided to make it static 
for sake of simplicity. 

This blog is about my pet-project. 
My first project at work in 2006 was a simple web-system that: 
* allows user to login in;
* get a number for internal electronic documents system; 
* allows an administrator to login and control numbers for users.

I like this project a lot, and I want to rebuild it in several ways:
* using new technologies for practice;
* using new approaches for practise.

## How-to run my blog post
I don't really sure about publishing it on hosting, but you can always run it with
docker - my favorite tools for building services.
* Clone this repository
* Change directory to src
* Run **docker-compose build** 
* Run **docker-compose up** or **docker-compose up -d*
* Open [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) in your browser.
